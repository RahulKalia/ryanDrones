My brother goes to Portsmouth University and this was my first ever time visiting.

I went without doing any research for the first time as my main reason travelling here was to help my brother bring his things home after completing his first year of university. He told me he would take me to the harbour as he thought it would be a clear and tranquil canvase and he was definitely right!

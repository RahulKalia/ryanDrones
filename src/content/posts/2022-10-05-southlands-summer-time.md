Aï»¿ good friend of mine had been given an opportunity to perform live infront of an audience for a charity event called Southlands Summertime Festival in West Drayton. This festival included a range of different genres of live music, comedy, dance, food/drink stalls and a kids zone. A great fun day out for everyone and my first event filming.

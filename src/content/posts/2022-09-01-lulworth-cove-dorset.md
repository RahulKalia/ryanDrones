This was my second time to Dorset, including Durdle Door. Unfortunately my previous visit I had my first casualty with the DJI Mini SE. Therefore after this occurance I was determined to come back and get some quality shots. The pictures speak 1000 words. It was a risky attempt of going out this far with the windy condtions but I was confident and committed not to come home with nothing again.

The luscious blue waters, pebbly beach and beautiful scenery, makes it a popular destination. I did my research on places round Dorset and because of the popularity, I had to visit while no one was around to capture the natural essence. Waking up extremely early for a 2hr+ drive to get there for the sunrise.

I want to drive everywhere in the UK to capture everything great on this Great British Island.

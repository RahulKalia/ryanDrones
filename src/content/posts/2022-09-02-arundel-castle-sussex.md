T﻿his was the day me and my girlfriend took a trip down to Littlehampton Beach to do some crabbing, which I have never actually done before. The sun was out but hidden behind the clouds most of the day. I was in shorts and t-shirt and due to the wind and the clouds I could not feel myself slowly getting toasted. After a few hours of being out, it was time to call it a day, it wasn't until we left for some classic fish and chips, the heat from inside the shop hit me and then realised how badly burnt I actually was. The back of my neck was completely blistered the next day, my arms and legs looking like drumstick sweets. Nearly a week off work from the restless nights sleep, AC on all day and night and covered in Aloh Vera Gel 24/7.

I﻿ was not a massive fan of the area to capture pictures or any footage to create a compilation video. Although I had a back up plan to go to Arundel Castle on the way home. 

What a sight to see up from a birds eye view, it made the sunburn almost worth it for what I had captured, the sun was clearly shining down without a cloud in the sky. While living next to Windsor Castle myself, but not being physically allowed to fly it anywhere near, it was great to be able to take these shots of such a beautiful fortress.

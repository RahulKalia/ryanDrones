A﻿fter purchasing my first drone, the first thing I wanted to do was to shoot a moving vehicle. Luckily for me I have a couple of good friends that own some very eye catching and flash cars. 

C﻿heck out the Youtube Logo Link on the home page for a cinematic video. This was made early on to getting my first drone, now owning the DJI FPV Mini, we will be recreating another video, now with a lot more experience. 

C﻿oming soon...

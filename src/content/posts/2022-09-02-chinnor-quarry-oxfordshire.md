  by geologists for its phenomenal history. Packed with fossils, some of the
  finds here date back 100 million years. There's no public access, but you can
  catch glimpses of its bright high-alkaline water from the surrounding

I﻿ was lucky with the timing of my visit to Chinnor due to a heavy rain that lasted around half an hour. It had started just as my first battery in my drone started to deplete, therefore me and my girlfriend waited it out as no one else was there and I always want to make the most out of my visits to wherever I go. 

T﻿his was meant to be an easy little adventure. Every location I go to, I make sure to check the air space apps as well as weather conditions to be as safe as I possibly can. Usually I will stay clear of any areas that tend to have a busy airspace such as nearby airports or helipads. I had a heavy rain fall that was unexpected, but the biggest challenge was the numerous helicopters flying over this Quarry, which should definitely be shown on 'drone maps'.

I﻿ was able manoeuvre safely to give right of way to the Helicopter. It was handy that for the time I was up in the air only 1 passed by, but after I captured what was intended, another 2-3 passed over.

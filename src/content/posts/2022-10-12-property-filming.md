A﻿ client of mine wanted some aerial shots of one of their properties in order to aquire some planning permission, in order for them to extend.

I﻿ was trusted by my client with their property to carry out my objective without their supervision. I provided both photo and video shots of their land the way they had invisioned. Also in doing this, I supplied mulitple heights of the video pan around the outside of the property and every possible angle for photographs. More than enough to choose their favourite shots.

T﻿he job was carried out on the property as well as reviewing the work. After the client was satisfied with what had been filmed, I then proceded to upload both types of files onto a provided USB and the exchange was made.

Iï»¿ went for a wander looking for an area to film one day. I came across Stoke Poges Memorial Gardens. The fact this place actually had no drone flying signs on the property and being a memorial ground I respectfully did not film around the actual gardens which is a beautiful place to take a walk. 

I therefore went as far out from the gardens and found Stoke Park House right next door.

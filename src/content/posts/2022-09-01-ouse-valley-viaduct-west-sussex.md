I found this hidden gem from a conversation with my barber. Later on that evening, I was on my way to visit this eye catching destination. 

Known for its ornate design, the structure has been described as "probably the most elegant viaduct in Britain.'' I hope these images give you the same opinion.

Everytime I go out to capture shots, I would love the sky to be clear and colourful from either a sunrise or especially a sundown. These are my two favourite times to film. Luckily for me there was not too many people around therefore it was safe and appropriate to carry out this flight.

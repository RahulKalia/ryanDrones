  Waverley Abbey was built from the vision of Cistercian monks in 1128.

  On mission from France, they constructed Waverley Abbey in order to live a monastic life, filled with prayer, manual labour and contemplative Bible reading.

Seems like every journey I go on to these new places I have found online, something always dramatic happens.

On the way to Farnham, around about 1hr from where I live, I was five minutes away from the destination when all of a sudden my battery warning light pops up on my dashboard. I said to myself, only 5 more minutes then I can really start to worry. Coming off of the motorway, my temperature gauge is going crazy, up then down then up again. Finally got to the car park, turned the engine off but the fan belt spun for around five minutes before stopping.

I﻿ am terrible with cars, topping up with oil, coolant an tyre pressure I'm a pro, anything else I don't have a scooby. Me checking under my bonnet, not realising the main drive belt had come off not powering my battery causing my light to come up. 

I﻿ was determined to get what I came for, I prioritised the drone over my car for the time being. After getting some shots and going for a peaceful walk, I was then left with no choice but to call my breakdown cover and get towed home to a garage to get repaired. I'm always happy when I come away with what I want, no matter the repercussions.
